# Agentic OS Dashboard

A local visual cockpit for your Claude Code usage. Shows rate limits, daily activity, routine runs, and one-click buttons to launch your Claude Code skills.

Runs entirely on your machine. Reads data from your local `~/.claude/` folder. Nothing ships to the cloud.

---

## What you're getting

- Three **gauges** at the top — your 5-hour token window, weekly token window, and daily routine cap
- A **cumulative activity chart** showing token usage over time with a live pulse animation
- **MCP server status strip** — which MCP servers are connected
- **Skill buttons** — click to run any Claude Code skill (configurable)
- **Activity feed** — tail of what Claude has been doing today

Everything styled like a cockpit/terminal readout. Dark Claude-warm palette.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you touch the code, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.10+** installed — [download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During install on Windows, **check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"**.
2. **Git** installed — [download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **Claude Code CLI** installed and signed in — if you haven't, follow [the official install guide](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code). You need to have run Claude Code at least once so it generates session data.
4. **A terminal** you're comfortable opening:
   - Windows: PowerShell or Command Prompt
   - Mac: Terminal.app or iTerm
   - Linux: whatever shell you use

Verify everything works:

```bash
python --version      # should say 3.10 or higher
git --version         # any recent version
claude --version      # confirms Claude Code is installed
```

If any of those fail, fix that first.

## Step 1 — Clone the repo

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agentic-os-dashboard.git
cd agentic-os-dashboard
```

(Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with the actual GitHub URL you were given.)

---

## Step 2 — Install dependencies

Still inside the `agentic-os-dashboard` folder, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Streamlit and the other Python libraries the dashboard needs. Takes about a minute.

**If you get permission errors on Mac/Linux**, try `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` instead.

---

## Step 3 — Create your `config.py`

The repo ships a template called `config.example.py`. Your personal config lives in `config.py`, which is gitignored so your paths and skills stay on your machine.

Copy the template:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell / CMD
copy config.example.py config.py

# Mac / Linux
cp config.example.py config.py
```

Now open `config.py` in any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, TextEdit, whatever) and edit these fields at the top:

- **`VAULT_PATH`** — the folder where Claude Code should run. For most people, this is their Obsidian vault or a project folder. Example on Mac: `Path("/Users/yourname/Documents/my-vault")`.
- **`VAULT_NAME`** — display name shown in the dashboard header. Just a label.
- **`CLAUDE_CLI`** — the full path to the `claude` executable. Find it by running `where claude` (Windows) or `which claude` (Mac/Linux) in your terminal.
- **`CLAUDE_PLAN`** — set to `"pro"`, `"max"`, or `"team"` depending on your Anthropic plan. Controls the daily routine cap on the third gauge.

The `SKILLS` list at the bottom defines the buttons. See the next section for how to customize it.

**Don't overthink this step.** If a path looks wrong, the dashboard will show an empty state instead of crashing. You can iterate.

### Adding your own skills

The `SKILLS` list in `config.py` is where the dashboard buttons come from. Each entry is a Python dict with these fields:

```python
{
    "label": "Morning Brief",                    # button text
    "prompt_template": (                         # what gets sent to claude -p "<here>"
        "Act autonomously. Do not ask for confirmation. "
        "Do not use AskUserQuestion. Run the /morning skill"
    ),
    "description": "AI news briefing",           # subtitle under the label
    "category": "daily",                         # "daily" or "content"
}
```

For skills that need input (a research topic, a URL, a video description), add `{input}` inside `prompt_template` and include `input_placeholder`:

```python
{
    "label": "Deep Research",
    "prompt_template": (
        "Act autonomously. Do not ask for confirmation. "
        "Do not use AskUserQuestion. Run /deep-research on: {input}"
    ),
    "description": "Multi-source research",
    "category": "content",
    "input_placeholder": "topic to research",
}
```

**Tips:**
- Start every `prompt_template` with `"Act autonomously. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not use AskUserQuestion."` — stops Claude from blocking the run mid-way to ask questions.
- `category: "daily"` groups the button with routines (counted against your daily routine cap). `category: "content"` groups with content/creative buttons.
- You can add as many or as few as you want. Delete the examples you don't use.
- Not sure what to add? See `PROMPTS.md` for prompts you can give Claude Code to build your `SKILLS` list for you.

## Step 4 — Run it

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit opens a browser tab at `http://localhost:8501`. If it doesn't open automatically, paste that URL into your browser.

**First-run expectations:**

- If you've been using Claude Code for a while, gauges and chart populate immediately.
- If you're brand new to Claude Code, you'll see empty gauges. Run a Claude Code session or two, then refresh the dashboard. Data appears once your `~/.claude/usage-data/session-meta/` folder has files.

**To stop the dashboard:** go back to the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.

---

## Step 5 — Adapt it to you (with Claude Code)

This is the fun part. The dashboard was built with Claude Code and it's built to be modified with Claude Code.

Open a terminal in the `agentic-os-dashboard` folder and run `claude`. Then try prompts like:

> "Look at this dashboard. I want to swap the terracotta accent for a cool blue palette. Show me the changes before applying."

> "Add a fourth gauge at the top that tracks my GitHub commits today by reading `git log`."

> "Rename the skill buttons and replace them with my own Claude Code skills. Here are the ones I want: [list]."

> "Change the header text from 'AGENTIC OS' to my brand name. Update the favicon too."

See `PROMPTS.md` for a longer list of tested starter prompts.

## Making it "always on" (optional)

Running `streamlit run app.py` in a terminal every day is annoying. Here are four ways to upgrade, from easiest to most polished.

### Option A — Double-click launcher (simplest)

A desktop shortcut that starts the server and opens the browser. One click, no terminal.

**Windows:** create `start-dashboard.bat` with this content:

```bat
@echo off
cd /d C:\path\to\agentic-os-dashboard
start "" http://localhost:8501
streamlit run app.py
```

Right-click → "Send to → Desktop (create shortcut)".

**Mac:** create `start-dashboard.command` with this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/agentic-os-dashboard
open http://localhost:8501
streamlit run app.py
```

Then run `chmod +x start-dashboard.command`. Double-click to launch.

### Option B — Autostart on login (always available at localhost:8501)

Dashboard runs in the background 24/7. You bookmark `http://localhost:8501` and open it anytime.

Easiest path: ask Claude Code to set this up for you.

> "Set up this Streamlit app to auto-launch on Windows login using Task Scheduler. Run in the background with no visible terminal. Open at localhost:8501."

Mac version:

> "Set up this Streamlit app to auto-launch on macOS login using launchd. Log output to a file. I want to visit localhost:8501 anytime and have it load."

Claude Code will generate the config file, tell you where to put it, and walk through the install.

### Option C — System tray icon

Dashboard lives as a tray/menubar icon. Click → opens dashboard in browser. Quit from the tray.

> "Wrap this Streamlit app in a Python system tray app using `pystray`. Icon in the tray starts/stops the server and opens the browser."

### Option D — Native desktop app (most polished)

Ship as a real app with its own window. No browser tab. Users don't know Streamlit exists under the hood.

Options: Tauri, Electron, or Pake. Heavier build.

> "Wrap this Streamlit app in a Tauri desktop shell. On launch, start the Streamlit server in the background and open a native window pointing at localhost:8501."

This is the path if you're productizing for others, not just yourself.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"streamlit: command not found"**
Python installed but scripts folder not on PATH. On Windows, reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked. On Mac: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` in your `~/.zshrc`.

**Dashboard loads but gauges are empty**
Your `~/.claude/usage-data/session-meta/` folder has no data yet. Run a Claude Code session. Refresh.

**"Permission denied" when running skills**
`PERMISSION_MODE` in `config.py` is set to `bypassPermissions`. If that's too risky for you, change to `"default"` — Claude will prompt per-tool.

**Dashboard shows my paths not yours**
You're running the original `config.py`. Go back to Step 3 and edit the paths.

**Port 8501 already in use**
Another Streamlit app is running. Kill it, or start this one on a different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`.

---

## What happens when you change the code

Streamlit auto-reloads when you save a `.py` file. Browser tab updates live. No restart needed.

**Exception:** `.streamlit/config.toml` changes require a full restart (Ctrl+C, then `streamlit run app.py` again).

---

## File map

- `app.py` — the whole dashboard (one big Streamlit file)
- `config.example.py` — template config. Copy to `config.py` and edit.
- `config.py` — **gitignored**. Your personal paths, plan, and skills. Never pushed to GitHub.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `.streamlit/config.toml` — Streamlit theme + server settings
- `assets/` — images, robot mascot sprites
- `PROMPTS.md` — starter prompts for customizing with Claude Code
